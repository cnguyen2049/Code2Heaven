					<h2 align="center">My history with Video games</h2>
					<p class="space">
					My earliest memories of playing video games was playing were on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer" target="_blank">PC</a> 
					in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s" target="_blank">90's</a> 2D games.
					The devices I used a lot as kid were the <a href="" target="_blank">Game boy</a> and <a href="" target="_blank">Playstation</a>. 
					The Game Boy ended up being the only <a href="" target="_blank">Nintendo</a> system's I ended up using 
					in my childhood eventually stopping at the <a href="" target="_blank">Game Boy SP</a>. I would later get a <a href="" target="_blank">Wii console</a> 
					for my sister, but for the most part I didn't get to use other Nintendo system's such as 
					the <a href="" target="_blank">Nintendo 64</a> very much so in a sense 
					I did miss out on those kinds of experiences.

						What was part of my "growing up as a gamer" was mainly through the influences of my family. One of my uncles had a Playstation and he would rent games and copy them later so I played many of the old classics such as Spyro, early Madden games, (some samurai games), and most importantly Metal Gear Solid. This explains why I have always backed Sony, and even stuck with the PS3 when everyone was getting Xbox 360's. My main influence mainly comes from my other uncle who was very much  <q>The PC gamer</q>  (built his own computers, and very into hardware/software design)
						he was very into RTS and RPG genre's. Examples of games he would play regularly Starcraft, Diablo II, Baulder's Gate, Age of Mythology, Age of Empires, and many others I can't recall. He had big into Dungeon & Dragon's , and growing up he was into classic old school role-playing games. I ended up playing many of these games also with him when possible. It is because of this influence that I became very heavily drawn into games which would eventually lead to me getting into computers, and software

						Now getting back to Nintendo( most probably the games I played the most as kid) included titles such as Fire Emblem, Pokemon, Golden Sun, (many others can't recall at the moment, but most probably spent too many hours playing). I grew up in a time in which anime, and games were linked to each other I can recall Pokemon boom with the Game boy, and the Digimon games on the Playstation. I even remember spending many nights playing a few fighting games I dedicated time to beat, and it wasn't Street Fighter( did play some Tekken though) it was in fact Gundam Battle Assault. Once I started hitting my teenage years I started moving on into more of the "western" scene of games with Halo, Rainbow Six, Jack and Daxter, and Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic to mention a few.
						I would continue to play a lot of more titles, but as I get older I have to space them out a little better than I did when I was a young teen. Hopefully I'll keep gaming for the rest of my life.

					Side Note:
					As I write this nostalgia really hit's home I should use an emulator to play most of these old games someday.
